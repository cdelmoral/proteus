# Provisioning

Run `./provision` from the repository root on macOS after creating and starting the VM. Lima owns the VM lifecycle; Provisioning never creates, starts, stops, or deletes a VM. See the [usage guide](./usage.md#operating-workflow) for lifecycle commands and targeting another instance.

## What a rebuild restores

Provisioning applies the Development Baseline: the software and non-secret configuration needed for development. It uses Ansible for system state and tools, then installs `dotfiles/home` as one opaque Managed Dotfiles collection with GNU Stow. Ansible does not manage each application's configuration separately.

The Development Baseline includes command-line development tools, pinned language runtimes, Docker, GitHub CLI, Neovim, Claude Code, OpenCode, T3 Code, and the Managed Dotfiles. Applications may download plugins or create caches and private state when first run after a rebuild.

Each Provisioning run installs pnpm, Claude Code, OpenCode, and T3 Code from their npm `latest` tags, upgrading existing installations when newer releases are available.

Provisioning also registers the official Claude Code plugin marketplace and runs `claude plugin install mattpocock-skills@claude-plugins-official` as the guest user. The skills are installed at user scope for all projects. Installing this public plugin does not require Claude Code sign-in; run `./enroll claude` when you start using Claude Code.

A rebuild does not restore VM-Local Credentials, Host-Injected Credentials, project repositories, uncommitted work, command history, caches, application state, or workspace state. Back up or publish work that must survive before deleting Proteus. Credential Enrollment and repository cloning happen again in the new guest.

T3 Code is installed as a command only. Provisioning does not start it, run a background service, expose a port, pair a client, configure T3 Connect, or choose another connection method. Run `./enroll t3` explicitly to authorize T3 Connect and install its persistent guest service. The service uses a separate pinned runtime; subsequent Provisioning upgrades the npm CLI without updating or restarting that service. Service upgrades remain explicit T3 operations.

See [rebuilding Proteus](./usage.md#rebuild-proteus) for the rebuild procedure and [Credential Enrollment](./credentials.md) for authentication after Provisioning.
